                Rūmī was a great Sufi mystic and poet in the Persian language, famous for his lyrics and for his didactic epic Mas̄navī-yi Maʿnavī (“Spiritual Couplets”), which widely influenced mystical thought and literature throughout the  world. <br>
                <h3>What is Rūmī’s philosophy?</h3>
                According to Rūmī’s philosophy, life should be a journey to union with the one true God, which is achieved by practicing love—by disregarding oneself as an independent being and turning toward the truth of God’s oneness. Aided by spiritual guides, one lives—loves—into that truth, gradually ascending to full knowledge of the one divine presence, then guiding others.
                <h3>What did Rūmī write about?</h3>
                Rūmī’s experience of love, longing, and loss made him turn to poetry. He wrote mystical love songs to his mystic teacher Shams al-Dīn, the Prophet Muhammad, and God; ghazals (short lyric poems, each cohering by a unity of subject and symbolism rather than by a logical sequence of ideas); and many robāʿīyyāt (quatrains with the rhyme scheme aaba).
